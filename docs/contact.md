# Contacting the Stig Team and Community

There are several ways to contact and communicate with the Stig Team and Community:

## GitHub Repository

[GitHub](http://github.com) provides a great online platform for communication, collaboration, and distribution of open source software and projects.

The [StigDB](https://github.com/StigDB/) GitHub organization is the primary location for all documentation, source code, issue tracking, and downloads for StigDB and its related projects. A lot of conversation occurs on issues and pull requests. Drop by and give it a browse.

## StigDB Mailing List

Some conversations are better in long-form. For that, we have our [StigDB mailing list](http://lists.stigdb.org/listinfo.cgi/stigdb-stigdb.org). This mailing list is [publicly archived](http://lists.stigdb.org/pipermail/stigdb-stigdb.org/), so you are always able to review past conversations.

## #stigdb Channel on freenode

For more real time conversation, we have the [#stigdb]() IRC channel on [freenode](http://freenode.net/).

## Stig Legal Email Address

Matters involving licensing, copyright takedown notices, contributor licensing agreements, and similar issued should be addressed to the [stig-legal@stigdb.org](mailto:stig-legal@stigdb.org) email address.
