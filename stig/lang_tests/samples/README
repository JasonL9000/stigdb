Welcome to the Stig sample code directory.
All of these samples compile (as of the late November release) but some of them will be more useful than others for you to read.

Older But Still Of Interest
===========================

sort.stig -- Implementation of mergesort in Stigscript.  Useful both to see the functional programming approach to mergesort as well as seeing how a unit test framework looks.  However, this is somewhat obsolete due to the fact that we now have a sorted_by sorting keyword built into the language.

fizzbuzz.stig -- the classic "fizzbuzz" programming question.

database.stig -- This shows a few sample functions to read and write to the database.

pointclick.stig -- The first Stig Demo program back in March, a demonstration of "Stupid Key Tricks", storing clicked points by their distances as keys so you get the sorted key list back.

time_diff.stig and time_pnt.stig -- these are samples of how we expect the time types to work eventually (though not all of it is implemented)

Everything Else
===============

The rest of the files in here are mostly small samples of one particular functionality of the language, like reduce, or filter, or known/unknown, conditional writes, etc.  Take a look through them to see examples of things that compile, but they're not full programs or anything.
