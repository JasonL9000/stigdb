/* <stig/lang_tests/general/empty_list_set_dict_aliases.stig>

   This Stig script tests creating simple empty lists, dictionaries, and
   sets and expanding them via concatenation, updating, and set union,
   respsectively.  This isn't meant to be comprehensive: It merely tests
   whether creating empty collections via type aliases works properly.
