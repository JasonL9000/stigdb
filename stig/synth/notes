defines: All have a 'type'.
  type, can recurse, must solve fully before symbolics
  func, can require others to be defined, has multiple scope levels,
  generator

  package
    -The package definition
    -Function from package
    Only can add a single simple, non-recursive. Can refer to a symbol outside our definition.

expressions:
  refer to a define
  magic 'that' binding for Reduce and friends
  list/set/dict type deduced from contents.
  Reduce - has a magic 'start' expr. Only usable in a reducer.
  magic free attribute on symbol. MUST have type explicitly.

address ordering

object type -> member type/name pairs. NOTE: No ordering

ranges: default 1 step, can do reals or ints, may be backwards (Compare ends?...)

collpase affix_expr. into value.

infix: Remember order doesn't matter

postfix:
  Pulling out members from objects.
  Pulling out position in address
  Typecast
  Func call - Just complete func first, pass all info (Including parameter binding) to symbolics

More Magic:
  db reads?
  assert passes type through.
  where makes a new scope
  given makes a function argument. Could be multiple levels in.

effecting:
  Special sub grammar, shouldn't be too bad. Can refer to bigger outside functions/expressions. Scope is limited/subset.
